30 Useful Eclipse Keyboard Shortcuts for Java Programmers
Here is my list of 30 chosen Eclipse IDE keyboard shortcuts for Java developers. It's useful for both core Java developers and Java web application development using Eclipse IDE for web development.

1) Ctrl + Shift + T for finding class even from jar

This keyboard shortcut in Eclipse is my most used and favorite shortcut. While working with a high-speed trading system has a complex code, I often need to find classes with the just blink of the eye. This eclipse keyboard shortcut is made just for that. No matter whether you have class in your application or inside any JAR, this shortcut will find it.

2) Ctrl + Shift + R for finding any resource (file), including config XML files

This is similar to above Eclipse shortcut with the only difference being that it can find out not only Java files but any files including XML, configs, and many others. However, this eclipse shortcut only finds files from your workspace and doesn’t dig at the JAR level.

3) Ctrl + 1 for quick fix

This is another beautiful Eclipse shortcut that can fix up an error in Eclipse. Whether it’s missing declaration, missing semi-colon, or any import related error, this eclipse shortcut will help you to quickly sort that out.

4) Ctrl + Shift + o for organize imports

This is another Eclipse keyboard shortcut for fixing missing imports. This is particularly helpful if you copy some code from another file and import all dependencies. You can see the Beginners Eclipse Java IDE Training Course to learn more about code formatting shortcuts in Eclipse.

Apart from these keyboard shortcuts, learning how to debug Java programs in Eclipse is also a skill. There are so many debugging tools and features available in Eclipse, which many Java programmer don't know about, e.g. conditional debugging, hit count, and remote debugging.

If you really want to become a good Java developer, I suggest you improve your debugging skills. If you need some help, Eclipse Debugging Techniques And Tricks is the best place to start with.
